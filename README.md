# P40 Underdog Project 

## Description
Our project is called "P-40 Underdogs," a dog support program intended to schedule walks and provide dog adoption.

## How to install readMe
To install a readMe file, you need a plain text file like "Notepad" on your Windows computer.
If you have a MacOS instead, you can download BBEdit as a text file, which would still function properly.
Once you have opened a text file, you can write whatever you want in the readme file.

Next, save the file as readMe.md
After saving the file, place the file into the main folder of your project.
You can also use a version control platform such as GitHub; others can view it.
