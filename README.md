## How to install readMe
If you want to install an readMe file, you need a plain text file like "Notepad" on your windows computer.
If you have an MacOS instead, you can download BBEdit as a text file and it would still function properly
Once you have opened a text file, you can write whatever you want in the readMe file.

Next, save the file as readMe.md
After saving the file, place the file into the main folder of your project
Additionally, you can use a version control platform such as GitHub and other people can view it.
